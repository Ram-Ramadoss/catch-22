# Catch-22

## About
Catch 22 is a data Visualization tool to see who supports and funds the "Yes" and "No" coalitions for California Proposition 22. 

Prop 22, the App-Based Drivers as Contractors and Labor Policies Initiative, is on the 2020 California ballot. It establishes different criteria for determining whether app-based transportation (rideshare) and delivery drivers are “employees” or “independent contractors.” The Yes Coalition suppports this initiative, which would classify app-based drivers as "independent contractors" and adopt labor and wage policies specific to app-based drivers and companies. The No Coalition opposes this initiative, which would mean California Assembly Bill 5 (2019) will be used to decide whether app-based drivers are employees or independent contractors. Courts in California as recently as August 2020 ruled that that AB5 requires these companies to classify their drivers as "employees."
